A quick reference for things that I found useful from time to time

## Replace literal \n with actual newline
# This is a two-line operation
sed 's/\\n/\
/g'
# similar but with awk
awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;'


## Get certificate metdata via CLI
# need openssl installed
openssl x509 -text -noout -in certificate.crt
